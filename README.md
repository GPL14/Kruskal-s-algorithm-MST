# Kruskal's-algorithm-MST
Write a program in C++ to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal’s algorithm. You can perform your experiments on the attached test file which contains
the description of a graph as an adjacency matrix. The program should do the following:

Apply Kruskal’s algorithm on the given graph to find the minimum spanning tree.
